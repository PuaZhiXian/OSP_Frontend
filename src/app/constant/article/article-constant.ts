      title: 'Burning Fossil Fuels',
      description: "The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases large amounts of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. These greenhouse gases trap heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.",
    },

      image: 'Deforestation.jpeg',
      title: 'Deforestation',
      description: "Cutting down trees reduces their ability to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and carbon stored in trees is released back into the atmosphere when forests are cleared.",

      image: 'Transportation Traffic-congestion.pbm',
      title: 'Transportation',
      description: "Fossil fuels used in cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making transportation a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.",

      title: 'Extreme weather',
      description: "Climate change is causing an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and floods. These events can result in property damage, loss of life, and displacement of communities.",

      image: 'Biodiversity loss.jpeg',
      title: 'Biodiversity loss',
      description: "Climate change is causing changes in ecosystems that are putting many species of plants and animals at risk of extinction. This loss of biodiversity can lead to imbalances in ecosystems and negatively impact human food and water supplies.",

      title: 'Reduce carbon footprint',
      description: "Our daily activities such as driving a car, using electricity, and even what we eat have a carbon footprint. To reduce your carbon footprint, you can switch to renewable energy sources, reduce your meat consumption, use public transportation, and choose energy-efficient appliances.",

      image: 'Plant tree.jpeg',
      title: 'Plant trees & support reforestation',
      description: "Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen. Therefore, planting trees and supporting reforestation initiatives can help reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
